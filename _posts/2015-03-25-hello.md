Lite is a live template engine. It:

* uses [Mustache](mustache.github.io)-compatible syntax for templates

* automatically, based on context, binds template to a reactive model
(based on [freak](https://github.com/atmin/freak))

* has computed properties

* is pure JavaScript, no dependencies, plays nice with others

* is fast, lightweight and predictable
